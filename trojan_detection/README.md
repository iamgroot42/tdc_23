# TDC 2023 (LLM Edition) - Trojan Detection Track

This is the starter kit for the Trojan Detection Track of TDC 2023 (LLM Edition). This folder includes code for running three baselines methods: [PEZ](https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.03668), [GBDA](https://arxiv.org/abs/2104.13733), and [UAT](https://arxiv.org/abs/1908.07125). The code is provided as a notebook (`example_submission.ipynb`) and a script (`example_submission.py`). These files also include the steps to generate `submission.zip` for uploading to CodaLab.

## Before You Start

### Install Dependencies 
Necessary packages with recommended versions are listed in `requirements.txt`. Run `pip install -r requirements.txt` to install these packages.

### Download Models

To download models, replace ACCESS_TOKEN in the command below with an access token for your Hugging Face account, or run `huggingface-cli login` and enter your access token. Then simply run the command with the subtrack and phase that you want to download models for.
```
python download_data.py --subtrack=base --phase=dev --token=ACCESS_TOKEN
```

## Usage

### Running Baselines and Generating Submissions
To run baselines with `example_submission.ipynb`, set the arguments and proceed from the top to the bottom of the notebook. Local evaluation is optional. To run baselines with `example_submission.py`, either set `--mode` to `val` for local evaluation or `test` to generate predicted triggers for the test targets, which can then be uploaded to CodaLab. For example, the following generates predictions with PEZ and saves them to the current folder.
```
python example_submission.py --subtrack base --phase dev --baseline PEZ --mode test
```
After generating predictions, move the saved predictions into an empty `submission` folder and rename them to `predictions.json`. Then run the following commands to create a submission.zip file for uploading to CodaLab:
```
cd submission && zip ../submission.zip ./* && cd ..
```

### Local Evaluation
Helper functions for local evaluation are in `eval_utils.py`. This code mirrors the evaluation server code. Local evaluation can provide a quicker estimate of performance without uploading your submission to CodaLab and may help with analysis of your method. The results from local evaluation should be nearly identical to the results in the leaderboard, save for small differences that may arise from our use of vLLM to accelerate evaluations for the leaderboard.

### Additional Information
- If you get an out-of-memory error while running baselines, try reducing the `batch_size` variable for the given baseline.
- The current code is designed to run on a single GPU. Some changes may be required to support multiple GPUs.
- Submissions must be zipped dictionaries with target strings as keys and lists of 20 predicted triggers for each target string as values.
